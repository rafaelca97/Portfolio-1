                    <span class="text">“Show, don’t tell” is one of the fundamental principles I've been learning in my
                        studies of narrative. It has been present in the conception, design, and development of this
                        personal web portfolio project.

                        <br>
                        What should I show? Very easy, I must show that I am a Full Stack Developer and all my training
                        to be able to make the leap into the professional world.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        With this premise, I had to find a way for the user to know from the outset that I am a Full
                        Stack Developer. And that way is by involving them on the website.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        How can they be involved? By using canvas.</span>

                    <span class="number">02</span>
                    <span class="text">While I was in the process of seeking inspiration, I was playing Cuphead, a video
                        game with a classic 1930s animation style known as 'Rubber Hose Style.' Truth be told, I fell in
                        love with that style and knew I had to include it there. Thanks to my background in filmmaking,
                        I knew that Disney had many films and shorts with that animation style, such as 'Silly
                        Symphonies' and 'Steamboat Willie,' among many others, where I could find the narrative and
                        visual elements to apply to my website.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Among the possibilities offered by canvas and HTML itself, I decided to create this friendly
                        astronaut with a distinctive cursor, so that the user can interact.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Thanks to my training as a UX/UI specialist, I knew where to place the elements in a visually
                        appealing and device-responsive manner for users viewing this webpage on various devices.</span>

                    <span class="text">Once all the information and visual elements were gathered, it was time to
                        translate everything onto the webpage. Thanks to my training as a web developer, I was able to
                        develop backend code mainly focused on the functionality of the canvases, and frontend code
                        using CSS and HTML5 languages.

                        <br>
                        With patience and by managing frustration (something quite common in our field), I was able to
                        finish this project. I am proud of it, and it teaches me that the path of learning is infinite
                        and full of possibilities.</span>
